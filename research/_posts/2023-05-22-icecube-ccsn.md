[Today in ApJL](https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/acd2c9), 
we detail a search for high-energy neutrino emission from core-collapse supernovae with IceCube. 

It has been long predicted that supernova should produce high-energy neutrinos, 
either through CSM interaction or via astrophysical jets.

Though long-predicted, we find no evidence of high-energy neutrino emission in our samples of supernovae.
Instead, we set limits on the overall neutrino emission from core-collapse supernovae.

However, we haven't given up hope yet! A larger sample of supernova, more years of IceCube data, or a galactic supernova could all lead to a detection of high-energy neutrinos from a supernova.
