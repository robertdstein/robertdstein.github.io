[Today in ApJL](https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ad3337), I led a paper describing a new machine-learning classifier to discover Tidal Disruption Events. 

TDEs are discovered in large numbers by wide-field optical surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), 
but the process is resource-intensive requiring lots of human scanning and spectroscopic observations.

Instead, **tdescore** is designed to discover TDEs using only photometric data from time-domain surveys, and available contextual information from archival datasets, to discover TDEs without the need for spectroscopic follow-up.

The problem is fairly tough, because TDEs represent a tiny fraction of all nuclear transients.

Nonetheless, **tdescore** is able to recover TDEs with high efficiency and low contamination.
Here you see that for a reasonable threshold chosen, **tdescore** can recover 80% of TDEs with a contamination rate of just 20%.

However, it is sometimes hard to trust the output of a classifier for science. **tdescore** is designed to be interpretable, so that you can understand why it made a particular decision.
Here's an example of a TDE candidate that **tdescore** classified as a TDE (top) and a supernova that **tdescore** rejected (bottom).
Though both objects have similar host galaxy properties, the lightcurve properties are enough to distinguish them.
