[Today in MNRAS](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2261), I worked on a paper describing the resaults of the ASAS-SN neutrino follow-up program. 

ASAS-SN has performed automated follow-up of 56 different neutrino alerts from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, making it the largest optical follow-up program to date.

No new counterparts were identified, but we were able to set limits on the optical emission from the neutrino sources. 
These limits many exclude the existence of a population of very bright neutrino sources.

The known associations of TDE AT2019dsg and blazar TXS 0506+056 were also recovered by ASAS-SN.
