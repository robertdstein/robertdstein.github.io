[Today in PRL](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.221101), we published another result from our ZTF neutrino follow-up program. 

In October 2019, we had already identified the [Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) AT2019dsg as the probable source of high-energy neutrino](https://robertdstein.github.io/research/2021/02/22/at2019dsg.html). 

In this new work, we report the discovery of a second likely TDE-neutrino association.
We found the candidate TDE AT2019fdr during follow-up of the high-energy neutrino IC200530A, detected by IceCube on 30th May 2020.
Having identified a new potential neutrino source, we triggered a broad multi-wavelength follow-up campaign to characterise the source.

The multi-wavelength properties of the source suggest it is most likely a TDE in an AGN. 

Finding two probable TDE-neutrino associations with our program is very unlikely to have happened by chance. 
The probability of finding two such bright TDEs coincident with neutrinos is just 0.034%.
Taken together, our two discoveries suggest that TDEs contribute at least 8% of the total diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube.
