	<h1>Code</h1>
	<p>You can find a selection of open-source coding projects on my github, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><b><a href="https://github.com/icecube/flarestack" target="_blank"> Flarestack</a>:</b>
				Unbinned likelihood analysis code I developed to do neutrino correlation studies.
				It has been used in multiple IceCube analyses, including for
				<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08547" target="_blank"> TDEs</a> and
				<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05170" target="_blank"> AGN cores</a>.</p></li>
			<li><p><b><a href="https://github.com/desy-multimessenger/nuztf" target="_blank">
				nuztf</a>:</b>
				The analysis pipeline I developed for filtering ZTF data coincident with external (Neutrino/GRB/GW) triggers.
				It uses the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05922" target="_blank"> AMPEL</a> software framework.</p></li>
			<li><p><b><a href="https://github.com/winter-telescope/mirar" target="_blank">
				mirar</a>:</b>
				Modular Image Reduction and Analysis Resource (MIRAR),
				an open-source modular python package for astronomy image reduction
				which I created with Viraj Karambelkar with Caltech.
				mirar was developed to reduce and analyze data from the Wide-Field
				Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) telescope at Palomar Observatory,
				but is also used by other instruments including SEDmV2 and DREAMS.</p></li>
