	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		I grew up in London, and did my undergraduate studies there at Imperial College.
		I completed my masters project in the Astroparticle group of the University of Hamburg.
		Since July 2017 I've moved into high-energy neutrino physics and multi-messenger astronomy.
		I did my PhD at DESY Zeuthen, supervised by
		<a href="https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~afrancko/" target="_blank"> Anna Franckowiak</a>.
		Now I'm a postdoc at Caltech working with
		<a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~mansi/" target="_blank"> Mansi M. Kasliwal</a>
		<br/><br/>
		I'm a member of two international scientific collaborations:

				Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)
			</a></h3>
			<p>	ZTF is an optical telescope on Mt Palomar, CA, USA.
				ZTF images the entire northern sky every two nights, and hunts for newly-detected objects (transients)
				that appear between observations. ZTF has already discovered
				<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12973" target="_blank">hundreds of supernovae</a>,
				seventeen <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01409" target="_blank">Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs)</a>,
				and many other exciting transients.

					Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER)</a></h3>
			<p>	WINTER is an upcoming infra-red telescope also being built on Mt Palomar. WINTER will be able to study
				the dynamic infra-red sky, and understand the properties of 'red' transients. With WINTER we will
				hunt for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves and neutrinos, and make new discoveries
				in a relatively unexplored wavelength.

	<p>My research interests include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><b>High-energy Neutrino Alerts:</b>
				We don't know exactly where high-energy neutrinos come from, but by observing the neutrino arrival
				directions with telescopes, we might be able to find out. With ZTF,
				I have led many of our neutrino follow-up campaigns. We successfully identified
				<a href="https://robertdstein.github.io/research/2021/02/22/at2019dsg.html" target="_blank">
					two TDEs as probable neutrino sources</a>. </p></li>
			<li><p><b>Gravitational-Wave (GW) + Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) follow-up:</b>
				Observations of the first Binary Neutron-Star merger from LIGO revealed a spectacular kilonova
				AT2017gfo, detected with a variety of telescopes. With ZTF we search for these kilonovae from
				the direction of GW/GRB triggers. </p></li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		I am also enthusiastic about Science Communication and Outreach.
		I won the Zeuthen Science Slam (2018) and the first DESY-wide Science Slam (2019).
		I've also supported the annual <a href="https://icd.desy.de/" target="_blank">International Cosmic Day</a>
		and <a href="https://masterclass.icecube.wisc.edu" target="_blank">IceCube Masterclass</a>
		outreach events for students.
