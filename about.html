	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Since July 2017 I've been a PhD student at DESY.
		I'm originally from London, and did my undergraduate studies at Imperial College London.
		I completed my masters project, as part of an Erasmus Exchange, in the Astroparticle Physics group of the University of Hamburg. The thesis topic was Reconstruction of Heavy Cosmic rays using Cherenkov Light.
		Now I've moved into the exciting field of high-energy neutrino physics and multi-messenger astronomy, as a member of the Icecube and ZTF collaborations.

		My research interests include:

	</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Icecube Neutrino Alerts.</b> When IceCube detects high-energy neutrinos, </li>
			<li><b>Neutrino Follow-up.</b> We don't know exactly where high-energy neutrinos come from, but by observing the neutrino arrival directions with telescopes, we might be able to find out. With ZTF, I have led many of our neutrino follow-up campaigns.</li>
			<li><b>Gravitational-Wave (GW) + Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) follow-up.</b></li>
			<li>Icecube multi-messenger correlation studies </li>
		</ul>
