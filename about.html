	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		I grew up in London, and did my undergraduate studies there at Imperial College.
		I completed my masters project in the Astroparticle group of the University of Hamburg, on the topic of Reconstruction of Heavy Cosmic rays using Cherenkov Light.
		Since July 2017 I've moved into high-energy neutrino physics and multi-messenger astronomy.
		I'm currently a PhD student at DESY Zeuthen, supervised by <a href="https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~afrancko/"> Anna Franckowiack</a>.

		I'm a member of two international collaborations:

			<p>	Buried beneath glacier ice at the South, the cubic-kilometer IceCube detector is the world's largest neutrino observatory.
				Completed in 2011, IceCube discovered high-energy astrophysical neutrinos for the first time in 2013.
				In 2017, IceCube identified the first likely neutrino source, a flaring blazar called TXS 0506+056.
				However, we still do not know where the rest of these neutrinos come from.
				Finding these neutrino sources is the central goal of neutrino astronomy.

	<p>My research interests include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><b>High-energy Neutrino Alerts:</b>
				We don't know exactly where high-energy neutrinos come from, but by observing the neutrino arrival
				directions with telescopes, we might be able to find out. I often lead the IceCube reporting
				of high-energy neutrinos when we detect them, and with ZTF,
				I have led many of our neutrino follow-up campaigns.</p></li>
			<li><b>Gravitational-Wave (GW) + Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) follow-up:</b></li> Observations of the first Binary Neutron-Star merger from LIGO revealed a spectacular kilonova AT2017gfo, detected with a variety of telescopes. With ZTF we search for these kilonovae from the direction of GW/GRB triggers.
			<li><b>IceCube multi-messenger correlation studies:</b> Analyses can identify correlations between neutrinos and astrophysical catologues. I performed the first IceCube correlation study with Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs).</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		I am also enthusiastic about Science Communication and Outreach.
		I won the Zeuthen Science Slam (2018) and the first DESY-wide Science Slam (2019).
		I've also supported the annual <a href="https://icd.desy.de/">International Cosmic Day</a>
		and <a href="https://masterclass.icecube.wisc.edu">IceCube Masterclass</a> outreach events for students.
