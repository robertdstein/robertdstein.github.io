	<p>Since July 2017 I've been a PhD student at DESY Zeuthen, supervised by <a href="https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~afrancko/"> Anna Franckowiack</a>.
		I grew up in London, and did my undergraduate studies there at Imperial College.
		I completed my masters project in the Astroparticle group of the University of Hamburg, on the topic of Reconstruction of Heavy Cosmic rays using Cherenkov Light.
		Now I've moved into high-energy neutrino physics and multi-messenger astronomy, as a member of the Icecube and ZTF collaborations.

		My research interests include:

	</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>IceCube Neutrino Alerts:</b> When IceCube detects high-energy neutrinos, it publishes alerts to publically notify astronomers around the world. </li>
			<li><b>Neutrino Follow-up:</b> We don't know exactly where high-energy neutrinos come from, but by observing the neutrino arrival directions with telescopes, we might be able to find out. With ZTF, I have led many of our neutrino follow-up campaigns.</li>
			<li><b>Gravitational-Wave (GW) + Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) follow-up:</b></li> Observations of the first Binary Neutron-Star merger from LIGO revealed a spectacular kilonova AT2017gfo, detected with a variety of telescopes. With ZTF we search for these kilonovae from the direction of GW/GRB triggers.
			<li><b>IceCube multi-messenger correlation studies:</b> Analyses can identify correlations between neutrinos and astrophysical catologues. I performed the first IceCube correlation study with Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs).</li>
		</ul>
